    The adjacent sibling selector specifies an element that immediately follows another
        element when both of the elements are siblings. Sibling elements share the smae
        parent element. The syntax is two selectors seperated by a plus (+) sign. The
        style is applied to the element specified on the right side of the plus sign
        when it immediatly follows the element specified on the left.

    <!--
    h1,first p, and second p are all siblings of the body tag
        the first p is the adjacent sibling of h1
        even though the second p is a sibling of h1, it is not an adjacent sibling of h1
        and therefore it won't be affected by the selector: h1 > p, which means affect the
        style of the p tag that is the adjacent sibling of h1 (the first p tag that come after h1)
