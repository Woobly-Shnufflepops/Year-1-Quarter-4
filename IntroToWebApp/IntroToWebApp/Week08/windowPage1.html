    <h4>Javascript Browswer BOM</h4>
    <p>
        BOM stands for Browser Object Model.<br />
        The BOM defines a set of precreated objects such as:
        window, screen, location...<br />

    See link: <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_window.asp">js browswer BOM</a>

    <h4>Javascript HTML DOM</h4>
    <p>
        DOM stands for: Document Object Model.<br />
        The browswer takes an HTML document and builds a tree hierarchy
        of all the elements in the HTML.
        Ever element is considered an object and therefore has properties
        and methods.
    </p>
    <p>
        There are other objects in the browswer such as:<br />
        Date, array, math, string
    </p>

    <h4>The document object</h4>
    <p>
        The <i> document.getElementById("id")</i> returns a reference
        to the first element with the given id, then use its properties
        to access or alter its content
    </p>
